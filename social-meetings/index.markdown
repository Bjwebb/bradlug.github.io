As well as the group's third Monday of the month meeting, we also have a purely social meeting once a month. These usually take place on a **Friday, from 8pm**, between the regular Monday meetings. Check the [BradLUG Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=j0levg4c0p2op08nf5elp3u50k%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/London) for scheduled social meeting dates.

We meet in a local public house in BradfordÂ and just have a chat about anything!

At the moment we are meeting at:
**The Corn Dolly, 110 Bolton Rd, Bradford, BD1 4DE**
