**No. Attending: 17**

Tonight we were joined by [Huw Davies](mailto:lem@bunny-comic.com), creator of the [Bunny web comic](http://bunny-comic.com/) to talk to us about using open source products in the creative space, with a focus on images for the web and for print. He spoke about [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/), [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/?lang=en&css=css/base.css), and [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net/) and a few useful command line tools. He gave a run down of the pro's and con's of each from his perspective, but demonstrated his enthusiasm for each of the products in the phrase 'It just works!".

Huw give us a demonstration of his typical work flow and showed us some of the techniques he uses to produce comics for print and for online viewing. He also showed us how he makes images for T-shirts and other media. Many people found his practical demonstrations rather helpful!

Don't forget that September meeting is **our official Birthday**! (We'll be 2 years old)  Andrea as kindly offered to to make cake!  Yes once again the cake is ! a lie (see what we did with that!)

Also discussed was some continuing development of the BradLUG website.
