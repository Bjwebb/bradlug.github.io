Without our regular note taker present, the minutes from June's meeting is a little lacking.  We spoke about Leeds Art Crawl, Flight Radar, Truecrypt, and secure VoIP whilst attempting to install Android on an EePC (and getting slightly further in doing so than WYLUG).



	
  * [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/) open source encrypted VoIP

	
  * [Truecrypt](http://truecrypt.sourceforge.net/) no-longer supported full disk encryption which may or may not be secure

	
  * [Flight Radar 24](http://www.flightradar24.com/) a network of Mode S aircraft trackers around the world

	
  * [Dump 1090](https://github.com/antirez/dump1090) open source project which allows monitoring of aircraft overhead using certain USB TV tuners, including military traffic which Flight Radar 24 hides

	
  * [Leeds Art Crawl](http://artcrawl.leedsdatamill.org/welcome) which maps public art based on tweets in an effort to fill in the missing records on Leeds City Council's public art
