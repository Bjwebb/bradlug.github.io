Nigel showed the video of RepRap, the 3D self-replicating printer:
[http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page](http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page)

Alice demonstrated Munin, which provides updates every ten minutes of the performance of a server:
[http://munin-monitoring.org/](http://munin-monitoring.org/)

and also Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA), a php/mysql tool for testing website vulnerabilities.
[http://www.dvwa.co.uk/](http://www.dvwa.co.uk/)

He demonstrated how it could test for a number of vulnerabilities.

Bradford CVS had put forward a number of ideas:
1. FOSS pieces on Wordpress and wikis which no one felt they could offer
2. 'five tipples;' a personal account of five pieces of software/web resources that people use as an alternative to staight articles. Two people volunteered for this.
3. putting on a competition among Bradford CVS voluntary organisations to be the guinea pig in a demonstration move from proprietary to FOSS software.
People supported this.

We also had a lot of geeky talk and a discussion about the future of the Forum
and Website.
