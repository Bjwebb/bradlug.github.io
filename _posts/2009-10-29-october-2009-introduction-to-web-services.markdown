[Lorna Mitchell](http://lornajane.net/) gave us a introduction to ‘web services’, and some idea about how to go about consuming them using PHP as your language of choice. This was run through of the talk she’s due to give at the [PHP Barcelona Conference](http://phpconference.es/) on the 30th/31st October. She can describe it better than I can….

“Creating a great web service or API means enabling your users to do great things with the tools you give them – and they’ll love you all the more for it. This session will show you how to build a elegant, useful web service. We’ll look at the design choices to be made, the pitfalls in this area, and how to make a stable service that just works. This session is essential for architects and developers alike, whether you’re already building services or are ready to begin, this will give you the grounding to do this well.”

Hopefully we’ll get a copy of the slides from her talk soon.
