**Shi and Kriss** demonstrated the [Oculus Rift](http://www.oculusvr.com/) virtual reality headset with a number of brave souls taking up the challenge; their recording of the session is at [copy.com](https://www.copy.com/s/jeqAsnQefkgeBUVR/bradlug).




**John H** then gave a short demonstration of the [GRAMPS](http://gramps-project.org/) genealogical software and also how to change the default colours in [LibreOffice](http://www.openlogic.com/wazi/bid/289690/A-more-colorful-LibreOffice-unveiled).




**David S** went through the [Curators 100 top websites](http://www.bl.uk/100websites/top100.html) that the British Library is to archive and then Richard Clayton's [blog (scroll down)](http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/) ‘Traceability in the the Queen's Speech’ in which he points out that the government's ‘snoopers charter’ involves subsidising extensions to IPv4 sites in order to collect data rather than pushing for IPv6 which will allow them to collect it anyway.
