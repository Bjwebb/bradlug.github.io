**Alice** introduced [logstash](http://logstash.net/), a tool for managing logs, parsing them and storing the results for later use, in their case to produce graphs using [graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/); `logstash` has good documentation. In response to a question, she also mentioned using [splunk](http://www.splunk.com/) to find errors in logs.

**John M** then passed round the latest ring, newly arrived from foreign parts, after which

**Richard** had a practice run at his presentation on the banking system, managing to persuade most of us that most of what we had been taught about money and the banking system was an illusion; in reality banks create money and the central banks just keep the score; only 10% of the money they create goes to increasing GDP while 90% is used in speculation. Richard is a member of a group seeking reform of the [Bank Charter Act 1844](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Charter_Act_1844) which, while restricting the supply of new banknotes, did not restrict the creation of new bank deposits, thus enabling banks in England and Wales to create money even though they cannot create banknotes.

He explained that China earns money in the form of US dollars which it then uses to buy US Treasury Bills on which it then earns interest.

**David S** introduced us to the mysteries of the [SlackBuilds](http://slackbuilds.org/) project through which people can build software to complement the [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/index.php/) core. SlackBuilds consists of a number of repositories containing the source for a number of programs along with a shell script to build each source with [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/). There is also a GUI option.

David contributes to the project with a script which automates checking the builds of each program and then reports his findings via Gmail to the maintainers â€” which he showed us in operation.
