Robert took us through the first part of his presentation on the legal fiction of IP covering copyright, patents and trademarks pointing out that IP law is framed by lawyers for publishers to maximise investor returns and imposed on consumers, producers and distributors.

John then introduced the [Cabinet Office survey on open source standards](http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/uk-government-open-standards-survey) which is very much aimed at integrators rather than individual users and David demonstrated [Quantum GIS](http://qgis.org/).
