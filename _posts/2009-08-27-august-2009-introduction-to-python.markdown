This month Bernard Czenkusz, of[ ](http://www.skipole.co.uk/)[Skipole Networks](http://www.skipole.co.uk/) gave us an introduction to the popular programming language [Python](http://www.python.org/)

If you’ve never dabbled with it before or want to get your feet wet with a little coding python could be the place to start! Bernie’s talk relied on having **python-tk** installed. This is usually available by the normal synaptic or apt-get procedure (Debian/Ubuntu flavours) but if you have trouble check out the official [python](http://www.python.org/) site for more help.

I thought it was a nice paced walk through/introduction. He has supplied the files he used as examples and they should get posted up here soon.
