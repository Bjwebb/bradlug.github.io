We had a general discussion around installing UEFI secure boot and then looked at a couple of April Fool RFCs: [RFC 1149](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1149.html) and [RFC 1925](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1925.html).




**John H** introduced the `js1k` competition to write a JavaScript programme in less than 1Kib by demonstrating





	
  * [demo 171](http://js1k.com/2010-first/demo/171)

	
  * [demo 1284](http://js1k.com/2012-love/demo/1284)

	
  * [demo 1377: a location bar version of Asteroids](http://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1377)

	
  * [demo 1451](http://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1451)

	
  * [demo 1459](http://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1459)




For each of these the compiled source is available and for some the original source.




Then we watched the video of [Steven Wittensâ€™ talk at _Full Frontal 2012_](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONN3jBly364&list=PLXmT1r4krsTrXThZIxcnzogf_YLOHRUZv&index=7) on vector animation.




**Nick** canvassed interest in the trip to Bletchley Park, probably at the end of June.
