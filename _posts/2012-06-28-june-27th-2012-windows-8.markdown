  Mike gave us a culture quiz - to help keep us all well rounded human beings, as

Richard gave us a guided tour of a [pre-release version of Windows 8](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/release-preview). There was a lot to be said about what Microsoft is trying to achieve, and how that relates to the rest of the IT world, devices and operating systems.

Mike gave us a culture quiz - to help keep us all well rounded human beings, as well as geeks! Well done to Andy for winning and taking the prizes, and thanks to Mike for organising.

Dave S suggested a monthly set of short 'How the Command Line can be your friend' talks, which everyone seemed to welcome.
