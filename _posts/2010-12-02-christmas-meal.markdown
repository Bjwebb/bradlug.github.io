Ok - we've finally bit the bullet on this one..

There are 2 options:
**Wetherspoons**
[http://bradlugmealwether.eventbrite.com/](http://bradlugmealwether.eventbrite.com/), or
**Omar Kahn's**
[http://bradlugmealomar.eventbrite.com/](http://bradlugmealomar.eventbrite.com/)

I've set up eventbright pages for people to sign up to their preferred option. This is not compulsory, but if we get lots of people signed up it might be useful to give the restaurants some fore-warning of our arrival.

After the meal, those that want will be meeting up at the **Corndolly pub** - aiming to be there around 8pm-ish.

Hope to see people there.
