**Brian** demonstrated [SqueezePlayer](http://www.squeezeplayer.com/), the Logitech version and [BubbleUPnP](http://www.bubblesoftapps.com/bubbleupnpserver/) running on a mobile ’phone to play/control a media centre.




**David C** played a video of [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) and demonstrated the [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) programming language for children.




**David S** showed how certain Cisco WPS routers which have a button to generate a code can be hacked in vulnerable networks with [reaver-wps](http://code.google.com/p/reaver-wps/) — which, if run for 12 hours, will detect the [WPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup) password. Of home routers, only the [Virginmedia](http://www.virginmedia.com/) ones are vulnerable.
