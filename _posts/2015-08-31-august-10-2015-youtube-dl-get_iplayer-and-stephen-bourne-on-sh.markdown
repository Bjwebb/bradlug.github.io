For the first time ever, no-one had come prepared with anything. So we welcomed Brian from Spain, talked about [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/) and [get_iplayer](https://github.com/get-iplayer/get_iplayer/) and watched the Stephen Bourne lecture about the [Early days of Unix and the design of sh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kEJoWfobpA).
