**John** demonstrated [Xfig](http://www.xfig.org/) which provoked some interest but also dislike of the interface.




**Mike** talked about [FreeSWITCH](https://www.freeswitch.org/), a rewrite of the [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) code which, when combined with a billing package, can provide an alternative. Currently people are restricted to [Skype](http://www.skype.com/en//) and Gizmo [no longer available] as there aren’t many subscribers to open systems or gateways between the different providers.




**David S** demonstrated the use of [Google Earth](http://www.google.com/earth/) plus various open source components in mapping a bog on Ilkley Moor using geophysics.




**Richard** mentioned the issues raised by the [Microsoft code donation](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/features/2009/jul09/07-20linuxqa.aspx) and the [CyanogenMod episode with Android](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod).




**David C** talked about the [Birmingham City Council](http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/) website developed by Capita and his own efforts to promote a site for cycling enthusiasts and how easy it was to get something up.




**Martyn** talked about a portal site for drama groups that he had developed.




We agreed on the dates of next year’s meetings.
