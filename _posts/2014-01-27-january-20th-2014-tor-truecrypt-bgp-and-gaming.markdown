**Alice** demonstrated how to [download Tor](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en); it is better to download it directly into your own user rather than from repos because the direct download gives you everything you need and is likely to be more up-to-date than the versions in repos. The download comes with a `start-tor-browser` script to run. The Vidalia graphical controller is included in the package and acts as a control panel.




Once members had installed Tor, they were encouraged to run [Panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) to find out how far they had been able to anonymise themselves; all those who were not running Tor found that their browser had a unique fingerprint by which they could be identified.




As David S pointed out during his presentation of [‘Tor Stinks’](http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-stinks-nsa-presentation-document) at the [October meeting](http://www.bradlug.co.uk/october-21st-2013-ogg-camp-libertree-and-snooping-again/), it is always advisable to run Tor while you have another connection to the Internet open. This prevents detection of Tor sessions through connections to and disconnections from the Internet.




**Alice** then drew attention to [TrueCrypt's hidden volume feature](http://www.truecrypt.org/docs/hidden-volume) and the vulnerability discovered in CBC-Encrypted LUKS partitions by [Jakob Lell](http://www.jakoblell.com/blog/2013/12/22/practical-malleability-attack-against-cbc-encrypted-luks-partitions/) before demonstrating [Hurricane Electric's BGP Toolkit](http://bgp.he.net/) which announces your own connections and allows you to examine data and graphs relating to the connections which any ISP has. This demonstrates that the Internet has no core; it is a mesh of connections. People pay for the fibre connection and the bandwidth which, in the UK, is charged in Mb/second. One pound gets around 1MB/second with discounts for larger volumes.




Access to a fibre connection is normally through peering, use of [dark fibre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_fibre) or sharing with another provider; with private peering, you provide the fibre to the connection. Public peering goes on between the IX connections all of which are owned by their members who pay a monthly fee.




This led into a discussion of the use of [Akamai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akamai_Technologies) to cache data for distribution locally as opposed to broadcasting data.




****David C then shared his recent experiences of re-investigating gaming, prompted in part by the Channel 4 programme [How videogames changed the world](http://www.channel4.com/programmes/charlie-brooker-videogames-changed-the-world) and [Indie Game: The Movie](http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/). For years his Nvidia Optimus card had not worked but now it does with [Bumblebee 3.2.1](http://www.webupd8.org/2013/04/bumblebee-321-released-with-ubuntu-1304.html). (There had been an [Epic Fail](http://forum.digitalpowered.net/index.php?showtopic=40920) in 2011.)




He has been looking at [SteamOS](http://store.steampowered.com/steamos/) and the [Humble Indie Bundle](http://www.indiegamebundles.com/tag/humble-indie-bundle/) which allows you to choose what you pay and a charity to support. He also recommended [Little Inferno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Inferno).




Members mentioned that Steam's move from Windows had been because Microsoft wanted a cut of Steam's income and that there is a lot of work being done on the Nvidia Optimus to which Steam is offering tweaks.
