With no presentations prepared, we talked about this and that, from [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/), a concurrent programming language that runs on [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/), to [openSPARC](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/opensparc/opensparc-overview-1562924.html).




We lamented the death of [Ian Murdock](http://ianmurdock.com/) [see [Ian Murdock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Murdock) if this link goes down] noting that the [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) distribution he created continues to support the widest range of architectures. [Gabriella Coleman summarises his importance for free and open source software in [Ian Murdock In His Own Words](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160112/16582733316/ian-murdock-his-own-words-what-made-debian-such-community-project.shtml).]




**Stephane** mentioned his interest in [software defined radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio) as he is currently studying for a radio operator’s licence. This led into two related discussions, one about FPGAs and the other about the [Open Base Station Architecture Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Base_Station_Architecture_Initiative) which describes what is needed to set up a mobile base station.




In the meantime, we also touched on [Dave Cutler’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Cutler) many contributions to computing, including [Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_NT), and the [YOCTO Project](http://www.yoctoproject.org/) to develop embedded Linux systems.




**Duncan** spoke about [Field Programmable Gate Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FPGA) (FPGAS), some of which have the analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) useful in software defined radio. IBM has recently acquired [Altera](http://www.altera.com/) which, along with [Xilinx](http://www.xilinx.com/), is one of the main providers of FPGAs. Xilinx produces the [MicroBlaze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroBlaze), support for which was merged into the Linux kernel and GCC in 2009.




For learning about FPGAs, he suggested the [Arty Artix](http://store.digilentinc.com/arty-board-artix-7-fpga-development-board-for-makers-and-hobbyists/) or [Basys](http://www.digikey.com/catalog/en/partgroup/basys-3-artix-7-fpga-board/49433) boards which come with the [Vivado](http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) toolkit. Unlike microprocessors which operate on a sequence of instructions, FPGAs are concurrent state machines.




Finally, in response to another comment, he noted that the [OpenSPARC T2](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/systems/opensparc/opensparc-overview-1562924.html) had had many features which were later introduced on Intel chips.
