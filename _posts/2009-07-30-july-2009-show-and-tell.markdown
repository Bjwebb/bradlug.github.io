With the abscence of a speaker/presentation we went for a ’show and tell’ session with people spending roughly 5-10 mins showing the rest of us something good!

We:



	
  * saw an accounting/VAT reporting application that one of us is building..

	
  * Learnt how to  compile our own custom kernel…

	
  * Discovered a music notation graphical user interface that makes working with Lillypond more fun…

	
  * Saw a demo of one members custom Linux distribution…

	
  * Found out how you would go about getting the information in a photograph of a poster directly onto your calendar (without typing!)…

	
  * Had a look at Places to Go, Things to do for young people…

	
  * Debated the issues around news that Microsoft have contributed to theLinux Kernel…


We also had birthday cake.

I thought it was a really good format, and one we should come back to -
maybe not every meeting (part of it’s charm was the fact that it was
different IMHO)
