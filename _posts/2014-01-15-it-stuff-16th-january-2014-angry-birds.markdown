[BCB 106.6FM](http://www.bcbradio.co.uk/)

This month we're angry about a lot of stuff, so tune in to hear us twitter on about:



	
  * The NHS sharing of your personal data and how to opt out

	
  * How Google are 'helping' you reach more people than you know

	
  * The Government's cyberstreetwise initiative

	
  * The gagging, erm we mean lobbying bill


...and the speaking computer failing to maintain control or order on the show.
