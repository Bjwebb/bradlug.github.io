Alice spoke about how it can be slow and painful setting up development environments, and gave a brief demo of her [Hadoop development environment](https://github.com/kaerast/chef-cdh-pseudocluster) which lets anybody deploy a virtual machine with all the necessary tools in minutes.  She spoke about how this can easily be copied for other environments using the Vagrant and Chef tools included.  [Bats Bash Automated Testing System](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) was shown which makes for nice readable tests.  Alice also showed how you can see what [location history](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0/) Google has noted about you, and shared some recent trips via this medium.

Discussion then veered off into big data, hadoop, map/reduce and scaling large systems.  A presentation from the NSA on their use of [Hadoop for big social graphs](http://www.pdl.cmu.edu/SDI/2013/slides/big_graph_nsa_rd_2013_56002v1.pdf) was shown, as were images of a [33 node beowulf cluster built with Raspberry Pi](http://hackaday.com/2013/05/21/33-node-beowulf-cluster-built-with-raspberry-pi/). Meanwhile we noted that [Obama is checking your email](http://obamaischeckingyouremail.tumblr.com/).
