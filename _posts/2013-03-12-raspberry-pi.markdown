The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/quick-start-guide) was the unexpected success story of 2012. Designed by a team led by Eben Upton, who as a tutor at Cambridge had become concerned about the poor computing skills of university applicants, and including David Braben, a veteran computer game designer, this credit card sized computer aims to put the fun back into computing. Costing only £25, it just needs a modern TV screen and a keyboard to become a working computer but it can connect to all the things a full-size computer can. Demand quickly outran supply and a new manufacturing facility was opened by Sony in South Wales to cope with it.




Kriss and Shi Blank from Bradford won the first competition to design a new game for the device; they came up with a “Ghostbusters”' style game where players have to learn Morse code to play the game and win jelly babies if they succeed in killing a ghost. There is some information about the game at [cpcpihack](http://leeds-hack.appspot.com/cpcpihack) and you can download the code to play on your own computer – it is free and will run on any computer, not just a Raspberry Pi – from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/xixs/cpcpihack). They try to design a new game one evening every month and they are all free to download.




Those working with children and young people will find this a much cheaper and more interesting way of introducing people to computing than using desktop computers and what they learn will help them with any computer. You can get them from [Farnell's](http://uk.farnell.com/raspberry-pi?CMP=KNC-GUK-FUK-GEN-KWL). Of course, you have to supply the monitor and keyboard but that still makes them far cheaper than almost any other computer.
