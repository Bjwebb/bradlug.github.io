**John H** demonstrated the very different approaches taken by two very different vector graphics programs, [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) and [Xfig](http://www.xfig.org/), by tackling the first two exercises in _Inkscape: Guide to a Vector Drawing Program_ (Third Edition) in both programs.




**Alice** demonstrated how to use [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to add effects to a bitmap image. `File>Import>Raw Data` with the `U-law` or `A-law` and `Mono` options set; then, carefully avoiding the header at the start of the file, apply one or more effects and `Export` with the options `RAW(headerless)` and `U-law` or `A-law` set.




**David S** rounded off the meeting with some choice news, like the [Economic Development Administration](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/us-agency-baffled-by-modern-technology-destroys-mice-to-get-rid-of-viruses/) that set about destroying over Â£100,000 of computing equipment in order to get rid of two well-known viruses that an anti-virus program could have dealt with.
